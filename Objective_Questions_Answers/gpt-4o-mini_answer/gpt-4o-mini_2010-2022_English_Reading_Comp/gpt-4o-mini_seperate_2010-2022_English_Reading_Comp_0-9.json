    "question": "C \nAlong  the river  banks  of the Amazon  and the Orinoco  there  lives  a bird that \nswims  before  it can fly, flies like a fat chicken , eats green  leaves , has the stomach  of a \ncow and has claws（爪） on its wings  when  young . They  build  their homes  about  \n4.6m  above  the river , an important  feature（特征） for the safety  of the young . It is \ncalled  the hoatzin . \nIn appearance , the birds  of both sexes  look very much  alike  with brown  on the \n  back  and cream  and red on the underside .

Using  these  four claws , together  with the beak（喙） , they can \nclimb  about  in the bushes , looking  very much  like primitive  birds  must  have  done . \nWhen  the young  hoatzins  have  learned  to fly, they lose their claws . \nDuring  the drier  months  between  December  and March  hoatzins  fly about  the \nforest  in groups  of 20 to 30 birds , but in April , when  the rainy  season  begins , they \ncollect  together  in smaller  living  units  of two to seven  birds  for producing  purposes . \n63.

    "question": "D \nScience  can’t explain  the power  of pets, but many  studies  have  shown  that the \n  company  of pets can help lower  blood  pressure （血压） and raise  chances  of \nrecovering  from  a heart  attack , reduce  loneliness  and spread  all-round  good  cheer . \nAny owner  will tall you how much  joy a pet brings . For some , an animal  \nprovides  more  comfort  than a husband/wife . A 2002  study  by Karen  Allen  of the State  \nUniversity  of New  York  measured  stress（紧张） levels  and blood  pressure  in people  \n--- half of them  pet owners  --- while  they performed  5 minutes  of mental  arithmetic （\n算术） or held a hand  in ice water . Subjects  completed  the tasks  alone , with a \nhusband/wife , a close  friend  or with a pet. People  with pets did it best. Those  tested  \nwith their animal  friends  had smaller  change  in blood  pressure  and returned  most  \nquickly  to baseline  heart  rates . With  pets in the room , people  also made  fewer  math  \nmistakes  than when  doing  in front  of other  companions . It seems  people  feel more  \nrelaxed（放松） around  pets, says Allen , who thinks  it may be because  pets don’t \njudge . \nA study  reported  last fall suggests  that having  a pet dog not only raises  your \nspirits  but may also have  an effect  on your eating  habits . Researchers  at Northwestern  \nMemorial  Hospital  spent  a year studying  36 fat people  and their equally  fat dogs  on \ndiet-and-exercise  programs ; a separate  group  of 56 people  without  pets were  put on a \ndiet program . On average , people  lost about  I1 pounds , or 5% of their body  weight . \nTheir  dogs  did even  better , losing  an average  of 12 pounds , more  than 15% of their \nbody  weight . Dog owners  didn’t lose any more  weight  than those  without  dogs  but, \nsay researchers , got more  exercise  overall  --- mostly  with their dogs  --- and found  it \nworth  doing . \n67. What  does the text mainly  discuss？　   　 \nA. What  pets bring  to their owners .      B. How  pets help people  calm  down . \nC. People ’s opinions  of keeping  pets.    D. Pet’s value  in medical  research . \n68.

According  to Allen , why did the people  do better  with pets around  when  facing  \n  stressful  tasks ? 　   　 \nA. They  have  lower  blood  pressure .     B. They  become  more  patient . \nC. They  are less nervous .             D. They  are in higher  spirits . \n70.

    "question": "C \nThousands  of people  living  in the Chinese  capital  will celebrate  the start of the \nChinese  New  year by heading  for the ski resorts（滑雪场） . Never  mind  that \nBeijing ’s dry weather  seldom  produces  snow . It is cold enough  in winter  for snow  --- \nmaking  machines  to make  a covering  for the hills north  to the capital . And the rapid  \ngrowth  of a pleasure  --- seeking  middle  class  has formed  the basis  for this new craze\n（热潮） .  \nSince  Beijing ’s first ski resort  was opened  ten years  ago, the sport  has enjoyed  \nastonishing  increase . There  are now more  than a dozen  resorts . Clothes  markets  in the \ncity have  added  bright  colored  ski suits to their winter  collections . Mr. Wei, a \nmanager  of a newly -opened  ski resort  in Beijing , sees the growth  of an industry  that \ncould  soon  lead Chinese  to head  for the ski resorts  of Europe . In recent  years  ski \nresorts  offering  natural  snow  have  opened  in China . But many  are in faraway  areas  of \nthe country  and can’t really  match  the equipment  and services  of some  ski resorts  in \nEurope .  \nBeijing ’s skiing  craze  is partly  a result  of the recent  increase  in private（私有的\n） cars. This has led to the growth  of a leisure  industry  in the capital ’s suburbs（郊区\n）, which  until the late-1990s  were  unreachable  to ordinary  people . According  to Mr.  \nWei, about  40% of the visitors  to his resort  come  in their own cars. The rest are bused  \nin by schools , businesses  or government  offices .  \nThe problem  is making  money . Starting  ski resorts  requires  quite  a lot of money ;  \nhiring  land from  the local  government , preparing  the hills, buying  snow  machines , \nmaking  sure there  are enough  water  and electricity  to run them , and buying  ski \nequipment  for hiring  out to customers .  \nThe ski resort  where  Mr. Wei works  cost nearly  $4m to set up. And as so often  in \nChina  when  someone  comes  up with a good  idea, many  others  hash in and price  wars  \nbreak  out. Beijing  now offers  some  of the cheapest  ski training  classes  in the world , \nthough  with most  people  rather  new to the sport , expecting  a few more  doing  the same  \n  job.  \n50. What  does this text mainly  talk about？　   　 \nA. Convenience  for skiers  brought  about  by private  cars.  \nB. Skiing  as a new way of enjoying  one’s spare  time.  \nC. Things  to be considered  when  starting  a ski resort .  \nD. A sudden  increase  of ski training  classes  in Beijing .  \n51. Why  are some  Chinese  likely  to go skiing  in Europe？　   　 \nA. To visit more  ski areas .              B. To ski on natural  snow .  \nC. For a large  collection  of ski suits.      D. For better  services  and equipment .  \n52. The underlined  words  “leisure  industry ” in Paragraph  3 refer  to　   　 \nA. transport  to ski resorts                \nB. production  of family  cars \nC. business  of providing  spare  time enjoyments  \nD part-time work  for people  living  in the suburbs  \n53. What  is the main  problem  in running  a ski resort？　   　 \nA. Difficulty  in hiring  land.            B. Lack  of business  experience .  \nC. Price  wars  with other  ski resorts .      D.

All we assume（推测） is that some  \nearly  men invented  certain  sounds , in one way or another , to express  thoughts  and \nfeelings , actions  and things , so that they could  talk with each other . Later  they agreed  \nupon  certain  signs , called  letters , which  could  be put together  to show  those  sounds , \nand which  could  be written  down . Those  sounds , whether  spoken  or written  in letters , \nare called  words .  \nThe power  of words , then, lies in their associations ---the things  they bring  up to \nour minds . Words  become  filled  with meaning  for us by experience ; and the longer  \nwe tire, the more  certain  words  bring  back  to us the happy  and sad events  of our past; \nand the more  we read and learn , the more  the number  of words  that mean  something  \nto us increases .  \nGreat  writers  are those  who not only have  great  thoughts  but also express  these  \nthoughts  in words  which  have  powerful  effects  on our minds  and feelings . This clever  \nuse of words  is what  we call literary  style（文体） . Above  all, the real poet is a \nmaster  of words . He can express  his meaning  in words  which  sing like music , and \nwhich  by their position  and association  can move  men to tears .
