But other  \nways,  like talking  to someone  you trust,  can lead you to solving  your problem  or at \nleast feeling  better.  \nTry taking  these  four steps.  the next time you are stressed:  \n(1) Get support.  When  you need  help,  reach  out to the people  who care about  \nyou. Talk to a trusted  adult,  such as a parent  or other  relatives.    72    They  might  \nhave  had similar  problems,  such as dealing  with a test, or the death  of a beloved  pet. \n(2) Don’t take it out on yourself.  Sometimes  when  kids are stressed  and upset  \nthey take it out on themselves.  Oh, dear,  that’s not a good  idea.  Remember  that there  \n  are always  people  to help you. Don’t take it out on yourself.    73    \n(3) Try to solve  the problem.  After  you’re calm  and you have  support  from  \nadults  and friends,  it’s time to get down  to business.    74    Even  if you can’t solve  \nit all, you can solve  a piece  of it. \n(4) Be positive.  Most  stress  is temporary  (暂时的 ). Remember  stress  does go \naway,  especially  when  you figure  out the problem  and start working  on solving  it.  \nThese  steps  aren’t magic,  but they do work.  And if you can stay positive  as you \nyou’re  your way through  a tough  time,  you’ll help yourself  feel better  even  faster.    \n75    \nA. Ask for a helping  hand  to get you through  the tough  situation.  \nB. Notice  your friends ’ feelings  and find a way to help them.  \nC. Different  people  feel stress  in different  ways.  \nD. Ah, it feels  so good  when  the stress  is gone.  \nE. You need  to figure  out what  the problem  is. \nF. And don’t forget  about  your friends.  \nG. Then,  find a way to calm  down.\n",

Banks,  companies,  and government  \nagencies  use secret  codes  in doing  business,  especially  when  information  is sent by \ncomputer.  \nPeople  have  used secret  codes  for thousands  of years.     36    Code  breaking  \nnever  lags (落后 ) far behind  code  making.  The science  of creating  and reading  coded  \nmessages  is called  cryptography.  \nThere  are three  main  types  of cryptography.     37    For example,  the first \nletters  of “My elephant  eats too many  eels”  spell out the hidden  message  “Meet  me.”  \n   38    You might  represent  each letter  with a number,  for example.  Let’s  \nnumber  the letters  of the alphabet,  in order,  from  1 to 26. If we substitute  a number  for \neach letter,  the message  “Meet  me” would  read “13 5 5 20 13 5.” \nA code  uses symbols  to replace  words,  phrases,  or sentences.  To read the \nmessage  of a real code,  you must  have  a code  book.     39    For example,  \n“bridge”  might  stand  for “meet”  and “out”  might  stand  for “me.”  The message  \n  “Bridge  out” would  actually  mean  “Meet  me.”     40    However,  it is also hard to \nkeep  a code  book  secret  for long.  So codes  must  be changed  frequently.  \nA. It is very hard to break  a code  without  the code  book.  \nB. In any language,  some  letters  are used more  than others.  \nC. Only  people  who know  the keyword  can read the message.  \nD. As long as there  have  been  codes,  people  have  tried to break  them.  \nE.

Americans eat only about fifteen pounds of fish per person per year, but we eat twice as much fish in restaurants as at home. Buying, storing, and cooking fish isn’t difficult.    37    This text is about how to buy and cook fish in an easy way.\n   38    Fresh fish should smell sweet: you should feel that you’re standing at the ocean’s edge. Any fishy or strong smell means the fish isn’t fresh.    39    When you have bought a fish and arrive home, you’d better store the fish in the refrigerator if you don’t cook it immediately, but fresh fish should be stored in your fridge for only a day or two. Frozen fish isn’t as tasty as the fresh one.\nThere are many common methods used to cook fish.    40    First, clean it and season it with your choice of spices (调料). Put the whole fish on a plate and steam it in a steam pot for 8 to 10 minutes if it weighs about one pound. (A larger one will take more time.) Then, it’s ready to serve.\nA. Do not buy it.\nB. The easiest is to steam it.\nC. This is how you can do it.\nD. It just requires a little knowledge.\nE. The fish will go bad within hours.\nF. When buying fish, you should first smell it.\nG.
